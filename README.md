# Pendulum Simulation Project

This project is a **JavaFX-based pendulum simulator** that visually animates a swinging pendulum and displays its motion through graphs such as angle vs. time and velocity vs. time. It is designed as a small physics/graphics project that demonstrates animation, geometry, and UI control in JavaFX.

## Features:
- Real-time pendulum animation
- Custumizable pendulum parameters (mass, length of the rope, gravity, damping, etc.)
- Graph window that displays graphs relevent to the pendulum
- Reset button that resets the animation and clears all graphs
  

###R Requirements
To run this project, there a few requirements. You must have JDK 17+ installed on your computer as well as an IDE that supports javaFX.

## How to run the project
1. Clone the repository using gitbash or the IDE:
    git clone https://github.com/AdamKhales/Pendulum-Simulation-Project.git
2. Open the project in your IDE
3. Add the JavaFx library to your project if the cloned ones don't work
4. Run the <mark>Main</mark> class to start the pendulum simulation
